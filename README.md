## Research Question
 * The agri-tech team is asking you to develop an interactive visualization tool of the results for this first crop season. This visualization tool that       you will develop will be used as a first mockup of the Food Security Monitoring tool that DDI will develop for the NGO.

 * Based on your experience, the team expects you to come up with a first draft within the coming 3 working days. They give you carte blanche in terms of structure and functionalities but they know that the client wants:

 * At least a map in the dashboard
 * The possibility of visualizing the results by district or sub-county (two administrative levels used by the NGO)
